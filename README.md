Youtube Comment Remove about Gambling (e.g., MAX33) in Thai language
This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze the meaning of user comments and determine whether they are related to gambling. The analysis is performed using a Bayesian Networks Model, which has achieved a high overall accuracy rate of 92%.

### Pre-requisites

You need two things for this to work:

1. To setup an OAuth client id in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
    * You will need to create a project, but you can use an account other than the one you wish to delete comments from if you wish.
    * You will need to configure an OAuth consent screen, just filling in the required stuff should be fine.
    * You will need to add yourself and anyone else that will be using this app as test users.
    * Once you have finished creating the OAuth client config, dowload the secret file, name it `client_secret.json` and place it in the top directory of the repo.
    * Once the OAuth client config is done enable the [Youtube Data API V3](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com).
    * How to Create client_secret.json
2. Go to Google Cloud Console
    *Create a new project
    *Enable YouTube Data API v3
    *Go to OAuth consent screen and configure it
    *Go to Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth client ID
    *Select Desktop App and download the client_secret.json file
