Software for Managing Gambling-related Comments (e.g., MAX33) on YouTube
In today’s digital landscape, YouTube has become a vital platform for content creators to connect with their audiences. However, a common and growing concern is the influx of spam and promotional comments related to online gambling platforms, such as “MAX33,” which can negatively affect the channel’s reputation and user experience.

To address this issue, we have developed a software solution designed specifically to manage and moderate gambling-related comments on YouTube channels. Key features include:

Automatic retrieval of recent comments from all videos on the channel

Keyword-based detection of gambling-related terms such as “MAX33,” “betting,” “baccarat,” “free registration,” and more

AI-powered sentiment and content analysis to distinguish between genuine comments and spam/promotional content

Automated removal of inappropriate comments based on customizable criteria

Logging of deleted comments for auditing and review purposes

Real-time notifications to alert administrators when high-risk comments are detected

This system helps channel owners maintain a clean and safe environment, protecting both their brand and their viewers from potentially harmful or unwanted content.
